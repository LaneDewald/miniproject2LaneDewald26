# Mini Project 2

This project will be using Pandas and Faker to create dataframes. This isn't intended to be full blown data science project. The goal here is to come up with some question and then see what API or datasets you can use to get the information needed.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Executing program

```
python main.py
```

## Output

This should create 5 graphs in Charts for the 2D data frames from Pandas with fake statistics on which U.S. cities have the most sunny days per year, and how does annual rainfall compare to average temperature?
